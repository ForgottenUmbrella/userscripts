Userscripts from Greasy Fork migrated to Github for my own convenience. To use,
please install them from Greasy Fork instead.

* Better Danbooru Artist Search: fix URLs and automatically navigate to the
wiki page.
* Personal YouTube Tweaks: change volume and speed based on my taste in
content.
* View Full Twitter Image: show the full image on navigating to the dedicated
page, and provide a download button that corrects file names.
* Test: just a test.
