# Personal YouTube Tweaks
Intended for my own use only. Feel free to use it though, but don't expect any support.
* Prevent YouTube from switching to the Share tab after a video finishes.
* Change video speed to 200% and music volume to 25%.

Note: I consider a video to be music if the title contains Japanese characters, hyphens, tildes, Touhou related terms or words generally appearing in videos containing mainly music.
