# Personal YouTube Tweaks
Intended for my own use only. Feel free to use it though, but don't expect any
support.
* Prevent YouTube from switching to the Share tab after a video is finished.
* Prevent autoplay.
* Change video speed to 200%, music volume to 25% and tries to lower the video
quality.
Note: a video is considered music if the title contains Japanese characters,
hyphens, tildes, Touhou related terms or words generally appearing in videos
containing mainly music.
