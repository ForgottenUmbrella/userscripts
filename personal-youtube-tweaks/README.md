# Personal YouTube Tweaks
Intended for my own use only. Feel free to use it though, but don't expect any support.
* Prevent YouTube from switching to the Share tab after a video is finished.
* Prevent autoplay.
* Change video speed to 200%, music volume to 25% and try to lower the video quality.

Note: a video is considered music if the title contains Japanese characters, hyphens, tildes, Touhou related terms or words generally appearing in videos containing mainly music.
Also note as of 2017: YouTube has been rebuilt with Polymer, meaning this script no longer fully works. In order to disable Polymer (and get this script working again), try this [userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/35388-disable-polymer-youtube-improved) (or just append "&disable_polymer=true" to the YouTube video URL).
