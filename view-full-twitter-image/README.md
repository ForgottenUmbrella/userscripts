# View Full Twitter Image
Retrieve images from Twitter in their original resolution after viewing the
direct URL (usually via `right-click -> Open image in new tab`).

Also provide a button to download the image, automatically renaming it to the
proper file extension (instead of the `.jpg-large` caused by Twitter's abuse of
URLs).
