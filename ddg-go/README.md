# DuckDuckGoogle
Redirect to Google if DuckDuckGo (DDG) fails (e.g. due to a proxy error).

Some schools' proxy servers interfere with DDG's privacy measures, so students
have to resort to Google. This userscript seeks to automate that process.

It is recommended that users don't sign in to Google, or use a container to
protect their privacy.
